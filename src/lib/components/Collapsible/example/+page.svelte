<Collapsible heading="🗞️ Paper">
  The invention of paper is attributed to ancient China, where it was first
  developed around 200 BCE. It was initially made from the fibers of mulberry
  trees. Paper is an incredibly versatile material that is used for various
  purposes, including writing, printing, packaging, and crafting. Paper
  production can have environmental implications, particularly when it involves
  deforestation and chemical-intensive processes. However, recycling paper helps
  reduce the demand for virgin materials and minimizes waste. Recycling paper is
  an essential practice to conserve resources. It helps save trees, reduce
  energy consumption, and minimize waste in landfills.
