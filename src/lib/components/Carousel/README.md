# Carousel

The `carousel` component provides a way to display a series of images or videos.

[WAI-ARIA: Carousel Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/)

## Features

### Automatic pause

The carousel will automatically pause when the user is interacting with it. This includes when the user is hovering over the carousel, or when the user is interacting with the carousel via the keyboard.

Also, if the user prefers reduced motion, the carousel will not automatically advance.
