# Interaction Mode

The `interactionMode` store exposes the current interaction mode.

It can be one of the following values:

- `null`: the user has not interacted with the page yet
- `pointer`: the user is using a mouse or a trackpad
- `keyboard`: the user is using a keyboard
- `virtual`: the user is using a screen reader or a switch device
